# Book-Recommender-System-Using-Collaborative-Filtering-and-Clustering
This project implements a collaborative filtering-based book recommender system using clustering to find similar books based on user ratings. The system is built to help readers discover books that match their interests by analyzing patterns in a dataset of user ratings, books, and user demographics. The project uses data preprocessing to clean and join datasets, builds a sparse matrix of ratings, and applies the Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find similar books. A recommendation function is created to generate book suggestions based on a selected book, complete with visual assets using book images.
